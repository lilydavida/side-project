# Side Project

What I build when I'm not at work.

## The Idea

Work through hard questions by building things:

- **Start with confusion** - Pick domains I don't fully understand
- **Build to learn** - Interactive tools and real data, not summaries
- **Show the reasoning** - Trace the path, include the wrong turns

## Current: AI Infrastructure Economics

Following the money through the AI stack - who's spending, who's earning, where the math breaks.

| Piece | Format | Question |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Tracing AI Capital Flows | Dashboard | Who actually profits in AI infrastructure? |
| Stop Chasing CUDs | Article | What if pricing reflected outcomes, not compute? |

## Process

1. Find where conventional wisdom is thin
2. Build something that forces clarity
3. Pressure test with real numbers
4. Write up what I learned (and where I was wrong)

## Stack

Next.js / Tailwind / Recharts / Financial Markets API
